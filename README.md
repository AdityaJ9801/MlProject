## Architecture Overview

Project 37 follows a service-oriented architecture with clear separation of concerns. The application has been optimized for performance with caching, parallel processing, and efficient streaming. For a detailed diagram of the optimized architecture, see [Optimized Architecture Diagram](diagrams/optimized_architecture.md).

The main components are:

1. **Web Server**: Flask-based HTTP server that handles requests and serves the web interface
2. **LLM Service**: Manages the language model for text generation
3. **Retrieval Service**: Handles document retrieval and similarity search
4. **Chat Handler**: Orchestrates the conversation flow
5. **Prompt Service**: Manages prompt templates and formatting
6. **Query Classifier**: Determines the type of query for appropriate handling
7. **Stats Service**: Collects and reports system metrics

### Data Flow

1. User sends a message through the web interface
2. The message is received by the web server and passed to the chat handler
3. The query classifier determines if the query is conversational or requires retrieval
4. For retrieval queries:
   - The retrieval service finds relevant documents
   - The prompt service formats the query with retrieved context
   - The LLM service generates a response based on the prompt
5. For conversational queries:
   - The prompt service formats the query
   - The LLM service generates a response
6. The response is streamed back to the user through the web interface

## Optimization Techniques

Project 37 implements several advanced optimization techniques to improve performance, reduce memory usage, and enhance search accuracy. These optimizations are critical for providing a responsive user experience, especially when dealing with large knowledge bases and complex queries.

### 1. Vector Search Optimization (ChromaDB Optimizer)

The ChromaDB Optimizer (`app/utils/chromadb_optimizer.py`) provides advanced optimization for vector search operations:

#### Dynamic HNSW Parameter Tuning

The optimizer automatically adjusts HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) parameters based on collection size:

| Collection Size | max_neighbors (M) | ef_construction | ef_search | Priority |
|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------|-----------|----------|
| Small (<10K)    | 32                | 200             | 100       | Recall   |
| Medium (10K-100K) | 24              | 150             | 80        | Balanced |
| Large (100K-1M) | 16                | 100             | 64        | Memory   |
| Very Large (>1M) | 12               | 80              | 50        | Memory   |

This ensures optimal performance for different collection sizes without manual tuning.

#### Query Complexity Analysis

The optimizer analyzes query complexity to adjust search parameters:

```python
def _analyze_query_complexity(self, query: str) -> str:
    # Count words
    word_count = len(query.split())

    # Check for complex structures
    has_quotes = '"' in query
    has_logical_operators = any(op in query.lower() for op in [" and ", " or ", " not "])
    has_special_chars = bool(re.search(r'[^\w\s]', query))

    # Determine complexity
    if word_count > 15 or (has_quotes and has_logical_operators):
        return "high"
    elif word_count > 8 or has_quotes or has_logical_operators or has_special_chars:
        return "medium"
    else:
        return "low"
```

This allows for adaptive `ef_search` parameters based on query complexity, improving both performance and recall.

#### Hybrid Search Implementation

The optimizer implements hybrid search combining vector similarity with metadata filtering:

```python
def perform_hybrid_search(self, collection, query, n_results=10, categories=None):
    # Extract metadata filters
    metadata_filters = self.extract_metadata_filters(query, categories)

    # Optimize query parameters
    search_params = self.optimize_query_parameters(query, n_results)

    # Perform query with metadata filtering and optimized parameters
    results = collection.query(
        query_texts=[query],
        n_results=n_results,
        where=metadata_filters if metadata_filters else None,
        include=["metadatas", "documents", "distances"],
        search_params=search_params
    )
```

This significantly reduces the search space and improves both performance and relevance.

### 2. Metadata Extraction (Metadata Extractor)

The Metadata Extractor (`app/utils/metadata_extractor.py`) analyzes user queries to extract metadata filters:

#### Category Extraction

```python
def _extract_category(self, query: str) -> Optional[str]:
    query_lower = query.lower()

    # Check for explicit category mentions
    category_match = re.search(r'category[:\s]+([a-zA-Z0-9_]+)', query_lower)
    if category_match:
        category = category_match.group(1)
        if category in [c.lower() for c in self.categories]:
            return category

    # Check for category names in query
    for category in self.categories:
        # Match whole words only
        if re.search(r'\b' + re.escape(category.lower()) + r'\b', query_lower):
            return category
```

#### Date/Time Filter Extraction

```python
def _extract_date_filter(self, query: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    filters = {}
    query_lower = query.lower()

    # Check for specific year
    year_match = re.search(r'\b(19|20)\d{2}\b', query)
    if year_match:
        year = int(year_match.group(0))
        filters["year"] = year
        return filters

    # Check for relative time terms
    for term, days in self.time_terms.items():
        if term in query_lower:
            today = datetime.datetime.now().date()
            cutoff_date = today - datetime.timedelta(days=days)
            filters["date"] = {"$gte": cutoff_date.isoformat()}
            return filters
```

#### Complex Filter Extraction

The extractor can handle complex filters with logical operators:

```python
def extract_complex_filters(self, query: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    # Extract basic filters first
    basic_filters = self.extract_filters(query)

    # Check for logical operators in query
    query_lower = query.lower()
    has_and = " and " in query_lower
    has_or = " or " in query_lower

    # If no logical operators, return basic filters
    if not has_and and not has_or:
        return basic_filters

    # If we have logical operators, create a complex filter
    if has_and and not has_or:
        # Simple AND case
        return {"$and": [{k: v} for k, v in basic_filters.items()]}
```

This sophisticated metadata extraction significantly reduces the search space and improves both performance and relevance.

### 3. Memory Optimization (Memory Optimizer)

The Memory Optimizer (`app/utils/memory_optimizer.py`) provides advanced memory optimization techniques:

#### Object Pooling

```python
class ObjectPool(Generic[T]):
    def __init__(self, factory: Callable[[], T], initial_size: int = 10, max_size: int = 100):
        self.factory = factory
        self.max_size = max_size
        self._lock = threading.RLock()
        self._pool = deque(maxlen=max_size)

        # Pre-populate pool
        for _ in range(initial_size):
            self._pool.append(factory())

    def acquire(self) -> T:
        with self._lock:
            if self._pool:
                obj = self._pool.pop()
                return obj
            else:
                return self.factory()

    def release(self, obj: T) -> None:
        with self._lock:
            if len(self._pool) < self.max_size:
                self._pool.append(obj)
```

This reduces the overhead of frequent allocation and garbage collection by pre-allocating objects and reusing them.

#### Embedding Buffer Pooling

```python
class EmbeddingBufferPool:
    def __init__(self, embedding_dim: int, initial_size: int = 10, max_size: int = 100):
        self.embedding_dim = embedding_dim
        self._pool = ObjectPool(
            factory=lambda: np.zeros(embedding_dim, dtype=np.float32),
            initial_size=initial_size,
            max_size=max_size
        )

    def get_embedding(self, embedding_function, text: str) -> np.ndarray:
        buffer = self.acquire()
        try:
            # Generate embedding
            embedding = embedding_function([text])[0]

            # Copy to buffer
            if len(embedding) == self.embedding_dim:
                np.copyto(buffer, embedding)
                return buffer
            else:
                return embedding  # Return original if dimensions don't match
        finally:
            # If an exception occurred or dimensions didn't match, release the buffer
            if len(buffer) == self.embedding_dim:
                self.release(buffer)
```

This specialized pool pre-allocates numpy arrays for embeddings and reuses them to avoid the overhead of frequent allocation and garbage collection.

#### Memory-Mapped Vector Storage

```python
class MemoryMappedVectorStorage:
    def __init__(self, file_path: str, vector_dim: int, max_vectors: int, dtype=np.float32):
        self.file_path = file_path
        self.vector_dim = vector_dim
        self.max_vectors = max_vectors
        self.dtype = dtype

        # Calculate file size
        self.vector_size = vector_dim * np.dtype(dtype).itemsize
        self.file_size = max_vectors * self.vector_size

        # Create or open the file
        self._create_or_open_file()

        # Create memory map
        self._create_memory_map()
```

This uses memory-mapped files to store vectors, allowing them to be accessed without loading the entire collection into memory.

### 4. Parallel Processing (Parallel Processor)

The Parallel Processor (`app/utils/parallel_processor.py`) improves throughput with parallel execution:

#### Task Prioritization

```python
class TaskPriority(Enum):
    HIGH = 0
    MEDIUM = 1
    LOW = 2

class ParallelProcessor:
    def __init__(self, max_workers=None, use_processes=False):
        self.max_workers = max_workers or min(32, (os.cpu_count() or 1) + 4)
        self.use_processes = use_processes
        self._executor = None
        self._priority_queues = {
            TaskPriority.HIGH: Queue(),
            TaskPriority.MEDIUM: Queue(),
            TaskPriority.LOW: Queue()
        }
```

This implements task prioritization for critical operations, ensuring that high-priority tasks are executed first.

#### Work Stealing

```python
def _worker_thread(self):
    while not self._shutdown:
        # Try to get a task from the queues in priority order
        task = None
        for priority in sorted(self._priority_queues.keys()):
            try:
                task = self._priority_queues[priority].get_nowait()
                break
            except Empty:
                continue

        if task is None:
            # No tasks available, sleep briefly
            time.sleep(0.01)
            continue

        # Execute the task
        func, args, kwargs, result_future = task
        try:
            result = func(*args, **kwargs)
            result_future.set_result(result)
        except Exception as e:
            result_future.set_exception(e)
```

This implements work stealing for load balancing, ensuring that worker threads are utilized efficiently.

#### Adaptive Thread Pool

```python
def _adjust_thread_pool(self):
    # Calculate optimal thread count based on system load
    cpu_count = os.cpu_count() or 1
    system_load = psutil.cpu_percent() / 100.0

    if system_load > 0.8 and self._thread_count > cpu_count / 2:
        # System is heavily loaded, reduce thread count
        self._thread_count = max(1, int(self._thread_count * 0.8))
    elif system_load < 0.5 and self._thread_count < self.max_workers:
        # System has capacity, increase thread count
        self._thread_count = min(self.max_workers, int(self._thread_count * 1.2))
```

This adjusts the thread count based on system load, ensuring optimal resource utilization.

### 5. GPU Optimization (GPU Optimizer)

The GPU Optimizer (`app/utils/gpu_optimizer.py`) accelerates operations with GPU:

#### GPU Memory Management

```python
class GPUMemoryManager:
    def __init__(self, device_id=0, reserved_memory=0.1, max_split_size=512):
        self.device_id = device_id
        self.device = torch.device(f"cuda:{device_id}")
        self.reserved_memory = reserved_memory
        self.max_split_size_bytes = max_split_size * 1024 * 1024  # Convert to bytes

        # Initialize memory pools
        self.pools = {}  # Size -> List of free blocks
        self.allocated = {}  # Pointer -> (Size, Block)
        self.lock = threading.RLock()

        # Reserve memory
        self._reserve_memory()
```

This efficiently manages GPU memory to avoid out-of-memory errors and fragmentation.

#### Mixed Precision Computation

```python
def optimize_tensor_operations(self, tensors, operation, dtype=torch.float16):
    # Convert tensors to GPU and lower precision
    gpu_tensors = [t.to(device=self.device, dtype=dtype) for t in tensors]

    # Perform operation
    with torch.cuda.amp.autocast():
        result = operation(gpu_tensors)

    # Convert result back to CPU
    if isinstance(result, torch.Tensor):
        return result.cpu()
    else:
        return [r.cpu() for r in result]
```

This uses lower precision (FP16) where appropriate for better performance.

#### CUDA Kernel Optimization

```python
def optimize_embedding_generation(self, texts, embedding_function):
    # Batch texts for efficient processing
    batch_size = min(len(texts), 32)  # Optimal batch size for GPU
    batches = [texts[i:i+batch_size] for i in range(0, len(texts), batch_size)]

    # Process batches with GPU acceleration
    results = []
    for batch in batches:
        # Generate embeddings
        embeddings = embedding_function(batch)

        # Apply CUDA optimization if available
        if hasattr(self, '_cuda_optimize_embeddings'):
            embeddings = self._cuda_optimize_embeddings(embeddings)

        results.extend(embeddings)

    return results
```

This optimizes CUDA kernels for specific operations, improving performance for embedding generation.

### 6. Caching Strategies

The system implements several caching strategies to improve performance:

#### LRU Cache for Embeddings

```python
@lru_cache(maxsize=1000)
def get_cached_embedding(self, text: str) -> List[float]:
    """Generate and cache embedding for a text."""
    return self.get_embedding(text)
```

This caches embeddings for frequently used texts, avoiding redundant computation.

#### Query Classification Caching

```python
def classify_query(self, query: str) -> str:
    # Define a cache key based on the query
    cache_key = f"query_classification:{query}"

    # Try to get the result from the cache
    cached_result = cache.get(cache_key)
    if cached_result is not None:
        return cached_result

    # Cache miss, perform the classification
    result = classify_query_intent_llm(query, self.llm_service, self.prompt_service)

    # Cache the result
    timeout = getattr(config, "QUERY_CLASSIFICATION_CACHE_TIMEOUT", 3600)  # Default: 1 hour
    cache.set(cache_key, result, timeout=timeout)

    return result
```

This caches query classification results, reducing latency for repeated queries.

#### Context Result Caching

```python
def retrieve_context(self, query: str, top_k: Optional[int] = None) -> List[str]:
    # Generate cache key
    cache_key = f"context:{query}:{top_k}"

    # Check cache
    cached_result = self._context_cache.get(cache_key)
    if cached_result is not None:
        return cached_result

    # Perform retrieval
    results = self._collection.query(
        query_texts=[query],
        n_results=top_k,
        include=['documents']
    )

    # Cache result
    context_chunks = results['documents'][0]
    self._context_cache[cache_key] = context_chunks

    return context_chunks
```

This caches retrieval results for identical queries, reducing latency for repeated queries.

### Performance Impact

## Integration Guide

### Adding a New Service

To add a new service to the application:

1. Create a new service file in `app/services/`
2. Implement the service with appropriate methods
3. Add the service to `main.py` initialization
4. Update `app/web_server.py` to include the service
5. Add any necessary API endpoints

Example:
```python
# app/services/new_service.py
class NewService:
    def __init__(self):
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        # Initialize service

    def is_available(self):
        # Check if service is available

def new_endpoint():
    # Access services
    new_service = current_app.new_service

    # Process request
    data = request.json
    result = new_service.service_method(data)

    # Return response
    return jsonify(result)
```
